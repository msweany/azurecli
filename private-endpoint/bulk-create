Create a CSV file that has the following headers
rg #resource group where the private endpoint will be deployed
pename #Name of the private endpoint
vnet #name of the vNet where the private endpoint will be deployed
subnet #subnet the private endpoint will be deployed
nic #The custom name of the network interface attached to the private endpoint.
dest #The resource id of the private endpoint to connect to.
plinkname #Name of the private link service connection.
location #Location the where the private endpoint will be deployed (values from az account list-locations)
destgroup # group ID of endpoint connecting to (IE: sqlServer)
zonename #Private DNS Zone name (IE: privatelink.database.windows.net)
zonegroup #Name of the private dns zone group.
zone #Name of the private dns zone.

#Either upload this CSV or save it where you run your Azure CLI commands
#make sure you're in the correct subscription 
az account show

#change to the correct sub if neede
az account set --subscription '<subscription id>'

#if uploaded to Azure, make sure the CSV doesn't have an extra encoding
dos2unix privatelinkfile.csv

#Copy/Paste the following code to skip the first line in the CSV, then grab each line and pass those variables to create the private link and add it to the privte DNS zone
